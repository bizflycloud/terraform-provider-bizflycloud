# Resource: bizflycloud_loadbalancer_pool

Provides a Bizfly Cloud Pool of Load Balancer resource. This can be used to create,
modify, and delete pools of Load Balancer.

## Example Create Pool for Load Balancer with TCP protocol

```hcl
# Create a new Pool for Load Balancer
resource "bizflycloud_loadbalancer_pool" "pool1" {
    name = "sapd-pool-tf-1"
    protocol = "TCP"
    algorithm = "ROUND_ROBIN"
    load_balancer_id = "${bizflycloud_loadbalancer.lb1.id}"
    members {
        name = "member2"
        address = "10.20.165.30"
        protocol_port = 80
        weight = 1
    }
    members {
        name = "member2"
        address = "10.20.165.40"
        protocol_port = 80
        weight = 1
    }
    health_monitor {
        name = "hm1"
        type = "TCP"
        timeout = 100
        max_retries = 3
        max_retries_down = 3
        delay = 5
    }
    persistent {
        type = "SOURCE_IP"
    }
}
```

## Example Create Pool for Load Balancer with HTTP protocol

```hcl
# Create a new Pool for Load Balancer
resource "bizflycloud_loadbalancer_pool" "pool1" {
    name = "sapd-pool-tf-1"
    protocol = "HTTP"
    algorithm = "ROUND_ROBIN"
    load_balancer_id = "${bizflycloud_loadbalancer.lb1.id}"
    members {
        name = "member2"
        address = "10.20.165.30"
        protocol_port = 80
        weight = 1
    }
    members {
        name = "member2"
        address = "10.20.165.40"
        protocol_port = 80
        weight = 1
    }
    health_monitor {
        name = "hm1"
        type = "HTML"
        timeout = 100
        max_retries = 3
        max_retries_down = 3
        delay = 5
        http_method = "GET"
        url_path = "/healthcheck"
        expected_code = "200"
    }
    persistent {
        type = "APP_COOKIE"
        cookie_name = "TEST"
    }
}
```
