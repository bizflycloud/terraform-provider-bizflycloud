Building The Provider
---------------------

Clone repository to: `$GOPATH/src/github.com/bizflycloud/terraform-provider-bizflycloud`

```sh
$ mkdir -p $GOPATH/src/github.com/bizflycloud; cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/bizflycloud
$ git clone git@github.com:bizflycloud/terraform-provider-bizflycloud
```

Enter the provider directory and build the provider

```sh
$ cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/bizflycloud/terraform-provider-bizflycloud
$ make build
```

Using the provider
----------------------

See the [BizFly Cloud Provider documentation](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/bizflycloud/bizflycloud/latest) to get started using the BizFly Cloud provider.

Developing the Provider
---------------------------

If you wish to work on the provider, you'll first need [Go](http://www.golang.org) installed on your machine (version 1.11+ is *required*). You'll also need to correctly setup a [GOPATH](http://golang.org/doc/code.html#GOPATH), as well as adding `$GOPATH/bin` to your `$PATH`.

To compile the provider, run `make build`. This will build the provider and put the provider binary in the `$GOPATH/bin` directory.

```sh
$ make build
...
$ $GOPATH/bin/terraform-provider-bizflycloud
...
```

In order to test the provider, you can simply run `make test`.

```sh
$ make test
```

In order to run the full suite of acceptance tests, run `make testacc`.

*Note:* Acceptance tests create real resources, and often cost money to run.

```sh
$ make testacc
```

For information about writing acceptance tests, see the main Terraform [contributing guide](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#writing-acceptance-tests).

Releasing the Provider
----------------------

This repository contains a GitHub Action configured to automatically build and
publish assets for release when a tag is pushed that matches the pattern `v*`
(ie. `v0.1.0`).

A [Gorelaser](https://goreleaser.com/) configuration is provided that produces
build artifacts matching the [layout required](https://www.terraform.io/docs/registry/providers/publishing.html#manually-preparing-a-release)
to publish the provider in the Terraform Registry.

Releases will appear as drafts. Once marked as published on the GitHub Releases page,
they will become available via the Terraform Registry.
