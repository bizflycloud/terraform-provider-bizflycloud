Provides a Bizfly Cloud AutoScaling Policy resource. This can be used to create, modify, and delete.

# bizflycloud\_autoscaling\_scalein\_policy

## Example
```hcl
# Create a new AutoScaling ScaleIn Policy
resource "bizflycloud_autoscaling_scalein_policy" "name" {
  cluster_id  = bizflycloud_autoscaling_group.maianh.id
  metric_type = "ram_used"
  threshold   = 10
  range_time  = 600
  cooldown    = 600
}

```

# bizflycloud\_autoscaling\_scaleout\_policy

```hcl
### Create a new AutoScaling Scaleout Policy
resource "bizflycloud_autoscaling_scaleout_policy" "name" {
  cluster_id  = bizflycloud_autoscaling_group.maianh.id
  metric_type = "ram_used"
  threshold   = 90
  range_time  = 600
  cooldown    = 600
}
```

### Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:
* `cluster_id` - (Required) The ID of AutoScaling Group
* `cooldown` - (Required) The time between two action continuous to do scale out/in
* `metric_type` - (Required) The metric type of policy
* `range_time` - (Required) The range time of policy when was reach to threshold value
* `threshold` - (Required) The threshold value was using make decision to do scale out/in
* `scale_size` - (Optional) The number member to do add/remove when to do scale out/in

### Atrributes Reference

The following attributes are exported:

* `cluster_id` - The ID of AutoScaling Group
* `cooldown` - The time between two action continuous to do scale out/in
* `metric_type` - The metric type of policy included:
    - `ram_used` - The metric is type percentage of ram used
    - `cpu_used` - The metric is type percentage of cpu used
    - `net_used` - The metric is type bandwidth of network
    - `request_per_second` - The metric is type request per second of load balancer if it was configured
* `range_time` - The range time of policy when was reach to threshold value
* `threshold` - The threshold value was using make decision to do scale out/in
* `scale_size` - The number member to do add/remove when to do scale out/in
